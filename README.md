AI-Code Scanner & Vulnerability Fixer

This project is an AI-driven system designed to scan source code, detect bugs and security vulnerabilities, and provide practical, easy-to-follow solutions to fix them.

- Why this project?

Many students and early-stage startups struggle with identifying and fixing issues in their code, especially security-related ones. This project aims to make the process:

🔍 Automated – Quickly scans your codebase for bugs and vulnerabilities.

🤖 Intelligent – Offers AI-powered suggestions to resolve issues effectively.

💬 Interactive – Includes a smart chatbot assistant that guides you step-by-step through fixing the problems.

- Key Features

✅ Automatic scanning for bugs and security vulnerabilities.

💡 AI-generated insights and practical code fixes.

💬 Smart chatbot to assist with debugging and secure coding.

🌐 Beginner-friendly – Ideal for students and startups with no deep security background.

- Goal

To simplify code security and debugging for everyone, making secure coding accessible and actionable using the power of AI.

Project Overview

This project provides a powerful, user‑friendly system to scan your code, find bugs and security vulnerabilities, and suggest fixes using artificial intelligence. Whether you're a student or part of a startup, this tool helps anyone secure their code without needing deep security expertise.

With a built-in chatbot assistant, it makes the whole process interactive: you submit code, it points out problems, and guides step-by-step to patch them.

🛠️ Key Features

✅ Automated Static Code Analysis: scans codebases for bugs and vulnerabilities

💡 AI-Driven Suggestions: proposes concrete fixes and improvement steps

💬 Interactive Chatbot Assistant: answers your questions, helps you through the fix

📂 Modular Design: easy to extend for new languages, vulnerability rules, or AI models

🌐 Beginner‑Friendly: ideal for students, devs new to security, and startups

You can adapt this structure: maybe you’ll have modules for training AI models, or APIs, or GUI, etc.

🧩 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ (or whichever version your project supports)

OpenAI API key (or whichever AI model/service you use)

Any other APIs or credentials needed (if you connect to vulnerability databases, etc.)

Installation & Setup
git clone https://github.com/your‑username/ai_code_scanner.git
cd ai_code_scanner
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env            # put your API keys or config there

Usage

To run a scan and then interact with the chatbot:

python app.py --path path_to_your_code_file.py


You can also integrate it into a web interface or GUI later.

🛣️ Roadmap & Future Plans

➕ Support for scanning multiple files / entire projects

➕ Add dynamic analysis (runtime / fuzz testing)

➕ Add more vulnerability rules and support for more programming languages

➕ Build a web dashboard to visualize scan results

➕ Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)

➕ Improve chatbot intelligence: context retention, code suggestions, interactive fixes
