AI-Code Scanner & Vulnerability Fixer

This project is an AI-driven system designed to scan source code, detect bugs and security vulnerabilities, and provide practical, easy-to-follow solutions to fix them.

- WHY THIS PROJECT? 


Many students and early-stage startups struggle with identifying and fixing issues in their code, especially security-related ones. This project aims to make the process:

 Automated – Quickly scans your codebase for bugs and vulnerabilities.

 Intelligent – Offers AI-powered suggestions to resolve issues effectively.

 Interactive – Includes a smart chatbot assistant that guides you step-by-step through fixing the problems.

- KEY FEATURES

✅ Automatic scanning for bugs and security vulnerabilities.

💡 AI-generated insights and practical code fixes.

💬 Smart chatbot to assist with debugging and secure coding.

🌐 Beginner-friendly – Ideal for students and startups with no deep security background.

- GOAL

To simplify code security and debugging for everyone, making secure coding accessible and actionable using the power of AI.

Installation & Setup
git clone https://github.com/FarisRaafat/ai_code_scanner.git
cd ai_code_scanner
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To run a scan and then interact with the chatbot:

python app.py --path path_to_your_code_file.py


You can also integrate it into a web interface or GUI later.

🛣️ Roadmap & Future Plans

 Support for scanning multiple files / entire projects

 Add dynamic analysis (runtime / fuzz testing)

 Add more vulnerability rules and support for more programming languages

 Build a web dashboard to visualize scan results

 Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)

 Improve chatbot intelligence: context retention, code suggestions, interactive fixes
